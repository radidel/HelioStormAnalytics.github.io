# Information about Solar Storms

- storm_event:
    name: Solar Flare
    description: A sudden burst of energy and radiation from the sun's surface.
    impact_on_earth: 
      - Causes radio signal disruptions
      - Can affect satellite communications
      - May lead to high-energy particle radiation in space

- storm_event:
    name: Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)
    description: Massive explosions of solar material and magnetic fields from the sun's corona.
    impact_on_earth: 
      - Can cause geomagnetic storms
      - Disrupts Earth's magnetic field
      - Affects power grids and transformers
      - May lead to beautiful auroras (Northern and Southern Lights)
      - Poses risks to astronauts and satellites in space

- space_weather_impacts:
    - impact_type: Geomagnetic Storm
      description: A disturbance in Earth's magnetic field caused by CMEs and solar flares.
      effects:
        - Can induce electric currents in power lines
        - May disrupt GPS signals
        - Affects high-latitude regions with spectacular auroras

    - impact_type: Radiation Storm
      description: High-energy particle radiation in space during solar storms.
      effects:
        - Poses health risks to astronauts in space
        - May impact satellite and spacecraft operations
